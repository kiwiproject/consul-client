# Change Log

## ü•ù Kiwi Project Notice ü•ù

_Under Kiwi Project this changelog will not be updated. It is here to retain history of the original project which
was maintained at [rickfast/consul-client](https://github.com/rickfast/consul-client/). Instead, we will use the
GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/kiwiproject/consul-client/releases) page as the offical changelog for
all releases performed under the `org.kiwiproject` Maven groupId._

_What follows is the original, unaltered changelog. It was never updated for releases after 1.0.1, which
includes a large number of releases up to the latest 1.5.3 release in July 2021. See the
[full list of releases](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.orbitz.consul/consul-client) for more information.
Note that no release documentation was produced for releases after 1.0.1, except for a few things noted in the
"Unreleased" section below. There is a link to the "Full Changelog" from 1.0.1 to HEAD (in the original repository)._
